# FLExo Atlas

Source code for the [FLExo Atlas](https://flexo.microbe.dev/), an interactive database with >5 million exotoxins and exotoxin-associated genes from nearly 700k prokaryotic (meta)genomes.

Exotoxins and associated genes were detected using [FLExo](https://github.com/lmc297/FLExo/tree/main), our machine-learning (ML)-based exotoxin annotation tool.
